# 🍞 Bakery Website — Assignment 3

This project is part of Route Academy’s Frontend Track.  
The goal was to rebuild parts of a bakery landing page using **classic layout techniques** — without Flexbox or Grid.

## 📋 What I Built
- Recreated 6 main sections: *Home*, *Who we are*, *Our Location*, *Our Baking*, and *Contact Information*
- Used `display: inline-block` for layout
- Used `float` and `clear` for the rest of the sections
- Non-responsive by design

## 🧰 Tools
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (no Flexbox / no Grid)

## 🎯 Challenges
- Managing spacing between inline-block elements  
- Controlling vertical alignment  
- Handling float layout and clearing correctly  

## 💡 What I Learned
- How traditional CSS layouts work before Flex and Grid  
- Importance of clear fixes  
- Better control over inline-block alignment
